`prog-vb` is a simple open source utility for programming your
FlashBoy (Plus) development cart from the command line.

This utility is mostly useful for Virtual Boy programmers; the [original
programmer](https://www.planetvb.com/modules/tech/?sec=tools&pid=flashboy)
provided is a (closed sourced!) Windows-only GUI application.
In my experience, I found the GUI broke my concentration when I had to
open the GUI and click around to program my flash cart each time I made
changes to my homebrew (of course I have worse concentration problems that
prematurely "ended" my VB homebrew career :P).

In addition, Mac/Linux users may find this application useful, since I'm
unaware of a Mac/Linux-based solution for FlashBoy. Releases can be found
[here](https://github.com/cr1901/prog-vb/releases). Currently releases are
made for the following Rust targets:

* `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
* `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf`
* `x86_64-apple-darwin`
* `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
* `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`

If you want a new target added to CI, ask me and I'll make a point release.

Why did I make this? For fun, mostly. I wanted an excuse to write some Rust.
And I've always wanted an open source version of the programmer :).

## Usage
At present, `prog-vb` takes one mandatory command line argument- the ROM
to flash to the cart. _The ROM must have been padded to 2 Megabytes
ahead of time._ `prog-vb` will automatically detect whether a FlashBoy is
present, so no need to mess with VIDs or PIDs.

Command line invocation is subject to change. The accepted arguments/usage
is display if a user types `prog-vb -h`.

When running the program for the first time on Windows 10, it is possible that
Windows Defender SmartScreen will block the app. As a workaround, click
"More information" on the warning window, and there will be an option to run
the program anyway. You should only need to do this once. _There is not much I
can do about this at present, as I don't have a code-signing certificate._

## TODO
* Developer Mode for quick flashing.
* Unexpected responses from FlashBoy are handled by failing immediately,
  without a good error message. I've yet to determine what types of
  messages to expect if programming fails.
* Do FlashBoy and FlashBoy Plus have different VID:PIDs?
