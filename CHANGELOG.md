# `prog-vb` Command Line Virtual Boy Flash Programmer

## [Unreleased]

## [v0.10.0] - 2019-03-07
### Added
- Input ROMs are now automatically padded to 2MB if necessary to satisfy
  the address decoding [scheme] of the Virtual Boy system.
- Add version `-v` command-line argument.
- Add check to ensure input ROM meets following conditions:
  - ROM >= 16kB (arbitrary lower limit- actual limit is 1kB).
  - ROM <= 2MB.
  - ROM size is power of two (required due to decoding [scheme]).

### Fixed
- By adding padding support, fix cryptic error message where ROMs < 2MB
  would fail when EOF was reached.

## v0.9.0 - 2019-03-04
### Added
- Minimal FlashBoy (Plus) programmer which uses [hidapi-rs] to program
  Virtual Boy ROMs.
- Use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/cr1901/prog-vb) and
  [Github Releases](https://github.com/cr1901/prog-vb/releases) to support
  x86_64 Windows, MacOS, and Linux binaries.
